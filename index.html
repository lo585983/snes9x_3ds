<p>Snes9x for 3DS is a high-compatibility SNES emulator for your old 3DS / 2DS. It runs many games at full speed (60 fps). It supports games that use CX4 chip (Megaman X2/X3), and the SDD-1 chip (Star Ocean, Super Street Fighter 2 Alpha). It can also play games that use the SuperFX chip (Yoshi's Island, etc) but they run with plenty of frame skips. It has generally much high compatibility than existing SNES emulators on the old 3DS because it uses Snes9x 1.43 as a base, and is a good alternative if your existing emulators cannot play all the games.</p>

<p>It also runs faster on your new 3DS!</p>

<a id="whats-supported" class="anchor" href="#whats-supported" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's supported</h2>

<ol>
<li>Graphic modes 0 - 5, 7. </li>
<li>Save states of up to 4 slots</li>
<li>Cheats - place your .CHT with the same filename in the same folder as your ROM. For example, if your ROM name is MyGame.smc, then your cheat file should be named MyGame.CHT.</li>
<li>Currently uses CSND for audio. So your entry point to home-brew must be able to use CSND. If you can play BlargSNES with sound, you should be able to play Snes9X_3DS with sound.</li>
<li>Frame skipping.</li>
<li>Stretch to full screen / 4:3 ratio </li>
<li>PAL (50fps) / NTSC (60 fps) frame rates.</li>
<li>Navigation of ROMs in different folders.</li>
<li>SDD1 chip (Street Fighter 2 Alpha, Star Ocean)</li>
<li>SFX1/2 chip (Yoshi's Island, but slow on old 3DS)</li>
<li>CX4 chip (Megaman X-2, Megaman X-3)</li>
<li>DSP chips (Super Mario Kart, Ace o Nerae)</li>
<li>Use of full clock speed in the New 3DS.</li>
<li>Sound emulation (at 32KHz, with echo and interpolation)</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="whats-missing--needs-to-be-improved" class="anchor" href="#whats-missing--needs-to-be-improved" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's missing / needs to be improved</h2>

<ol>
<li>Some sound emulation errors.</li>
<li>All the other add-on chips. </li>
<li>Mosaics.</li>
<li>In-frame palette changes - This is because this emulator uses the 3DS GPU for all graphic rendering. Without in-frame palette changes implemented, a small number of games experience colour issues.</li>
<li>Sprite layering issues.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="change-history" class="anchor" href="#change-history" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Change History</h2>

<li>Added option to change in-frame palette handling. There are three options to choose from: 
   > Enabled. (Slow, accurate, but never as accurate as software) 
   >  Disabled Style 1 (faster, less accurate)
   > Disabled Style 2 (faster, less accurate) works a little differently from Style 1 
  Most games are by default Disabled Style 2. 
  Bahamut Lagoon and Front Mission Gun Hazard are by default Disabled Style 1. 
  Wild Guns, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever are by default Enabled.</li>

<li>Resynchronise sound when you go into the menu (you can reset the sync this way after waking your 
3DS from sleep mode)</li>

Games that use this mode include: Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Air Strike Patrol, and a number of others.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.5</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented major graphic rendering optimizations for color handling, transparency and window effects.
Although codes from BlargSNES was not used directly, ideas came from BlargSNES.

<li>Added settings to allow user to amplify volume (per game)
(beware of sound clipping that results in terrible sounds)</li>
<li>Palette hack for Secret of Mana to ensure that the dialog borders are blue 
(the bottom status window still behaves oddly due to palette changes)</li>
<li>Transparency fixes:
o Legend of Zelda's prologue's dark room

(eg. in NHL's EA Sports intro screen)</li>
<li>Added speed hack for games that use the WAI instruction 
(esp Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, 3 should see a good speed increase)</li>
<li>Added hack to avoid hiding sprites even if they exceed the maximum number the real hardware can display.
Apparently, this fixes the missing cursor in Final Fantasy III.</li>
<li>And other bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.35</p>

<ul>
