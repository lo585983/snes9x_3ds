It supports games that use CX4 chip (Megaman X2/X3), and the SDD-1 chip (Star Ocean, Super Street Fighter 2 Alpha). It can also play games that use the SuperFX chip (Yoshi's Island, etc) but they run with plenty of frame skips. It has generally much high compatbility than existing SNES emulators on the 3DS because it uses Snes9x 1.43 as a base, and is a good alternative if your existing emulators cannot play all the games. \r\n\r\nIt also works and runs faster on your new 3DS!\r\n\r\nDownload the latest from:\r\n   https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/releases\r\n\r\nGive feedback / report bugs here:\r\n   https://gbatemp.net/threads/snes9x-for-old-3ds.435568/\r\n\r\nTo use:\r\n\r\n##Homebrew Launcher:\r\n\r\n1. Copy Snes9x_3ds.3dsx and snes9x_3ds_top.png into the /3ds/snes9x_3ds on your SD card. \r\n2. Place your SNES ROMs inside any folder.\r\n3. Go to your Homebrew Launcher (through Cubic Ninja) and launch the snes9x_3ds emulator.\r\n\r\n##CIA Version:\r\n\r\n1. Use your favorite CIA installer to install snes9x_3ds.cia into your CFW.\r\n2.
