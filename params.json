  "body": "##Snes9x for 3DS\r\n\r\nSnes9x for 3DS is an SNES emulator for your old 3DS / 2DS. It runs many games at full speed (60 fps). It supports games that use CX4 chip (Megaman X2/X3), and the SDD-1 chip (Star Ocean, Super Street Fighter 2 Alpha). It can also play games that use the SuperFX chip (Yoshi's Island, etc) but they run with plenty of frame skips. It has generally much high compatbility than existing SNES emulators on the 3DS because it uses Snes9x 1.43 as a base, and is a good alternative if your existing emulators cannot play all the games.\r\n\r\nDownload the latest from:\r\n   https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/releases\r\n\r\nGive feedback / report bugs here:\r\n   https://gbatemp.net/threads/snes9x-for-old-3ds.435568/\r\n\r\nTo use:\r\n\r\n###Homebrew Launcher:\r\n\r\n1. Copy Snes9x_3ds.3dsx and snes9x_3ds_top.png into the /3ds/snes9x_3ds on your SD card. \r\n2. Place your SNES ROMs inside any folder.\r\n3. Go to your Homebrew Launcher (through Cubic Ninja) and launch the snes9x_3ds emulator.\r\n\r\n###CIA Version:\r\n\r\n1. Use your favorite CIA installer to install snes9x_3ds.cia into your CFW.\r\n2. Place your SNES ROMs inside any folder.\r\n3. Copy snes9x_3ds_top.png to ROOT of your SD card.\r\n4. Exit your CIA installer and go to your CFW's home screen to launch the app.\r\n\r\n###When in-game,\r\n\r\n1. Tap the bottom screen for the menu.\r\n2.

You can quit the emulator to your homebrew launcher / your CFW's home screen.\r\n\r\nFeedback and bug reports are welcome. Help with development is also welcome!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Seiken Densetsu 3 (English Patch)](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_1.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nSeiken Densetsu 3 (English Patch)\r\n\r\n![Secret of Mana](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_2.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nSecret of Mana\r\n\r\n![Super Mario Kart](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_3.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nSuper Mario Kart\r\n\r\n![Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey & Donald](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_4.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nDisney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey & Donald\r\n\r\n![Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_5.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition\r\n\r\n![Megaman X](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_6.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nMegaman X\r\n\r\n![Megaman X3](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_8.jpg?raw=1)\r\n\r\nMegaman X3\r\n \r\n![Castlevania - Dracula X](https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/images/snes9x_7.jpg?raw=1) \r\n\r\nCastlevania - Dracula X\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n##What's supported\r\n\r\n1. Graphic modes 0 - 5, 7. \r\n2. Save states of up to 4 slots\r\n3. Cheats - place your .CHT with the same filename in the same folder as your ROM. For example, if your ROM name is MyGame.smc, then your cheat file should be named MyGame.CHT.\r\n4. Currently uses CSND for audio. So your entry point to home-brew must be able to use CSND. If you can play BlargSNES with sound, you should be able to play Snes9X_3DS with sound.\r\n5. Frame skipping.\r\n6. Stretch to full screen / 4:3 ratio \r\n7. PAL (50fps) / NTSC (60 fps) frame rates.\r\n8. Navigation of ROMs in different folders.\r\n9. SDD1 chip (Street Fighter 2 Alpha, Star Ocean)\r\n10. SFX1/2 chip (Yoshi's Island, but slow on old 3DS)\r\n11. CX4 chip (Megaman X-2, Megaman X-3)\r\n12. DSP chips (Super Mario Kart, Ace o Nerae)\r\n13. Use of full clock speed in the New 3DS.\r\n14. Sound emulation (at 32KHz, with echo and interpolation)\r\n\r\n##What's missing / needs to be improved\r\n\r\n1. Some sound emulation errors.\r\n2. All the other add-on chips. \r\n3. Mosaics.\r\n4. In-frame palette changes - This is because this emulator uses the 3DS GPU for all graphic rendering. Without in-frame palette changes implemented, games experience colour issues.\r\n5. Sprite layering issues.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n##Change History\r\n\r\nv0.6\r\n- Default sound amplification to 2x  …\r\n- Reduced GPU freezing problem after loading new ROMs / resetting too many times\r\n- Resynchronise sound when you go into the menu (you can reset the sync this way after waking your \r\n  3DS from sleep mode)\r\n- Improved sound sample rate to 32 KHz, and added echo and interpolation. The result is overall \r\n  better sound quality\r\n- Improved sync between SPC700 emulation and the DSP.\r\n- Fixed Contra III Mode 7 EXTBG colors again.\r\n- Enabled the SPC700 Envelope Height reading.\r\n- Fixed Chrono Trigger music not resuming after any battle music or “sealed by mysterious force” music.\r\n\r\nv0.51\r\n- Implemented pseudo hi-res mode 5 using alternate frame flickering to achieve the pseudo hi-res mode. \r\n  Games that use this mode include: Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Air Strike Patrol, and a number of others.\r\n  \r\nv0.5\r\n- Implemented major graphic rendering optimizations for color handling, transparency and window effects.\r\n  Although codes from BlargSNES was not used directly, ideas came from BlargSNES.\r\n  Some games that use windowing effects should see some / significant performance increase.\r\n  F-Zero (US / EUR versions) run full speed.\r\n  Super Mario Kart (EUR) runs full speed.\r\n  Axelay (US) runs at a playable speed.\r\n  Breath of Fire 2 battle transition effects are smooth.\r\n  Super Mario World circular window fade-in/out effects are smooth.\r\n  etc.\r\n- Fixed sprite flickering problems in Yoshi's Island and DKC2.\r\n- Fixed 256-color background problems. DKC1/2 and Earthworm Jim 2 intro shows up correctly.\r\n- Fixed Mode 7 BG2 problems. Now Super Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back (snowspeeder stage) works correctly.\r\n\r\nv0.42\r\n- Minor optimisation to GPU drawing\r\n- Increased maximum number of cheats to 200.\r\n- Fix the crashing problem if there are too many cheats in the .CHT file.\r\n- Fixed the too many sprites on screen problem (fixes Shadowrun freezing)\r\n\r\nv0.41\r\n- Fixed some transparency issues with Saturday Night Slam Master and Ghost Chaser Densei.\r\n- Updated SRAM saving timing.\r\n- Minor optimisation for SuperFX emulation.\r\n- First implementation of speed hacks (experimental for F-Zero, Axelay,\r\nSuper Mario Kart, Yoshi’s Island)\r\n- Modified some debugging stuff.\r\n- Fixed some mode 7 glitches when a mode 7 game (like Super Mario Kart has been running for more than a few minutes)\r\n- Implemented palette flickering hack for Front Mission Gun Hazard, Bahamut Lagoon.\r\n- Implemented hack for Power Rangers Fighting Edition to prevent graphical glitches\r\n- Implemented hack for delayed SRAM (per 1 minute) saving for Star Ocean\r\n- Fixed the problem of loading up too many different ROMs once after another, causing the loading to finally fail.\r\n- When loading a game without settings, reset the frame rate setting to be based on the game's region.\r\n\r\nv0.4\r\n- Experimental cheat feature. Requires you to have the .CHT file\r\n  (May corrupt your save game, use at your own risk)\r\n- Added settings to enable turbo buttons (per game)\r\n- Added settings to allow user to amplify volume (per game)\r\n  (beware of sound clipping that results in terrible sounds)\r\n- Palette hack for Secret of Mana to ensure that the dialog borders are blue \r\n  (the bottom status window still behaves oddly due to palette changes)\r\n- Transparency fixes:\r\n  o Legend of Zelda's prologue's dark room\r\n  o Reported dark tints on several games like Doremi Fantasy, Bomberman, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger\r\n  o Gradient shading on dialog boxes for Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III (battles) appear correct.\r\n- Fixed window clip problems.\r\n- Fixed mode 7 glitches causing mode 7 bugs in Secret of Mana, NHL 94, Magical Quest 3 \r\n- Fixed a number of sprite clipping problems \r\n  o Megaman 7's Dr Wily's spaceship in the intro now pans in from the left correctly\r\n  o Tales of Phantasia's trainee's sprites (after the intro) now clips correct \r\n- Fixed color inconsistency causing some white sprites to be visible on a white background \r\n  (eg. in NHL's EA Sports intro screen)\r\n- Added speed hack for games that use the WAI instruction \r\n  (esp Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, 3 should see a good speed increase)\r\n- Added hack to avoid hiding sprites even if they exceed the maximum number the real hardware can display.\r\n  Apparently, this fixes the missing cursor in Final Fantasy III.\r\n- And other bugs.\r\n\r\nv0.35\r\n- Fixed Super Mario Kart grass area texture outside of the track. \r\n  This fix should work for all cases.\r\n- Some minor performance and UI adjustments\r\n\r\nv0.34\r\n- Mode 7 minor performance improvements and update to draw Super Mario Kart's grass outside of the racing track. (some it works only under some conditions)\r\n- Taking of screenshot now only captures the upper screen.\r\n- Option of forcing frame rate to 50 FPS / 60 FPS / or based on the selected ROM's region.\r\n- Additional screen scaling option to 320x240.\r\n- Fixed the crashing problem when selecting options without any ROM running\r\n- Fixed DKC1 piracy problem. The wrong mask logic was used when writing to SRAM.\r\n- Improved the logic to save SRAM to SD card about 1-2 seconds after your game was saved in the emulator.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\n1.
